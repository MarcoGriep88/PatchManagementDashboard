# Patch Management Dashboard

## What is this
This Software is a Web Dashboard that will bring more transparency into your Patch Management. This Software combines the Reporting of (in my optinion) three of the best Applications in their Category:

- Windows Updates with WSUS
- Third Party Software Rollouts and Updates with Chocolatey
- Inventory and Reporting for Assets with Lansweeper
- Driver Updates with Fujitsu Deskupdate Manager (Only Fujitsu Hardware possible)

## How to use this
The Software is a set of multiple Web-APIs (Microservices) and Background Scripts that work like little gears with eachother. Each Component is replaceable and optional (In Example: No Fujitsu Hardware? Then you dont need the Microservice of Fujitsu Deskupdate Manager). The Dashboard will show you all the data of the different microservices and give you alot of transparency.

## Components
At the current Stage there are multiple components. Each Component has its own Repository on Github and is Open Source. Feel Free to enhance this collection.
